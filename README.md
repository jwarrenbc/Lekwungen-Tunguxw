# K̓ʷə́nəxʷ Lək̓ʷaŋən Təŋəxʷ (Seeing Lekwungen Land)

Map of Lək̓ʷáŋən place names assembled by Jared Warren of the Xʷsépsəm (Esquimalt) Nation. Everyone is welcome to learn and use these Lək̓ʷáŋən words, First Nations and settlers alike.

Primary sources were the personal recollections of Čeyɫəm (Dr. Elmer George), recorded by Andrew Cienski, and the [First Voices site for Xʷsépsəm Lək̓ʷáŋən](https://www.firstvoices.com/lekwungen). Additional sources are noted on individual features.
