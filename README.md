# K̓ʷə́nəxʷ Lək̓ʷaŋən Təŋəxʷ

Map of Lək̓ʷáŋən place names assembled by Jared Warren of the Xʷsépsəm (Esquimalt) Nation.

Primary sources were the personal recollections of Čeyɫəm (Doctor Elmer George), recorded by Andrew Cienski, and the [First Voices site for Xʷsépsəm Lək̓ʷáŋən](https://www.firstvoices.com/lekwungen). Additional sources are noted on individual features.
